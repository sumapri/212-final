# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to my python data structures tutorial. These data structures is critical for all programmers personal to learn more about **Data Strutures**. The better you get with using them, the better developer you will be in the future. The data structures that I choose today are:
- [Queue](queue.md)
- [Sets](sets.md)
- [Tree](tree.md)

Each module will contain real-life examples and descriptions on the data structure that I'd choose. At the end of each module you will find a problem to solve regarding the data structure learned. There will be a solution to the problem that you can look at after you have attempted the problem first.
